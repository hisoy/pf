This project started with discussion of IoT(Internet of Things) and a lecture of Bruce Sterling, the Scifi writer. He and professor Massimo Banzi were doing a project together, Casa Jasmina. This house is in Turin and it will be the demo-house of IoT where anyone can visit and experience one future of digital technology. When I got this brief, I was so excited. I love home, I love making new things, I always thought that I could spend my life to make things for home. My friends and I always talked about some possible inventions related to house, now I just have to choose one and build it!</p>
<p>In the first phase of ideation, there were Many ideas. A magnetic blanket, community garden made of lights, talking mirror and etc. Yet, the more I thought about each idea and talk about those with friends and classmates, the more I got confused. Why do we need More things? Is it necessary to waste all the resources, the labor force of factory workers and so on just to make more toys?</p>
<p>After iterations, Riccardo and I decided to focus on Lpify, a hybrid music player. Whenever I watch movies, I always was intrigued by mix-tape, collection of vinyls and cassettes. Having a hardcopy of a music felt really neat and personal. From there the idea of a music player run by vinyl with handwriting came out.</p>
<p>Initially, we maintained a box-shaped LP player. Yet, while talking about how to handle the que of vinyl records, we decided to use a slope. Slope became a track, and the track soon got attached to the wall.</p>
<p>I did the software part, recognizing the handwriting and connecting it to music streaming service with the help of python. Riccardo worked on arduino and actualizing the choreography. Installing layers of libraries (image processiong, OCR, music streaming API) was pretty fun. On the other hand, Ricarrdo suffered a lot due to unreliable plywoods, a subtle warping of the wood made LP record get stuck all the time and yeah, it was not easy.<br /> <br />This is the final prototype of Lpify. We minimized the appearance and unlike the first prototype, the choreography of moving one vinyl to the other is all covered and only can be assumed. (from the different height of vinyls, and the sound.) By simplifying the external design feature and using the same color vinyl, we wanted to draw attention to the core concept of Lpify. Music is more than an entertainment that floats around and fills the space. It is something that peoplechoose for themselves, something that people share and get bonded, and something that lasts.</p></div>
