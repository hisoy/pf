         <span>About the time of graduation, I read an interesting article about ICTD, Information and Communication Technology for Development. As I have been harboring doubt about the "cool" digital technology (i.e, where is the "meaning" in digital technology?") ICTD seemed really attractive and I wanted to be a part of the relevant project. I contacted Dr. Bernardine who was working on the field and got a chance to join her project, Navpal. The goal of the project was to provide safe and independent navigation of urban environments for the blind population. My role was to understand the navigation of visually impaired population and design an virtual indoor navigation system. The very idea of developing an application for disabled people was new and exciting.</span><br /><br /><span>A highlight of the project was user research: meeting visually impaired people. One interviewee talked about how he enjoys exploring surrounding environments by using canes, which made me stunned. Would I ever be able to enjoy the surrounding, when I can't see anything, when I have to pay close attention to slight inclination of the roads, when there is a high probability that I can get hit by a car, when my outside surrounding has been the source of pain, accidents, troubles from the beginning of my life? I'll rather stay inside my crib, listening to music, occasionally cursing my life. The positive and proactive attitude of interviewees was very provocative; I didn't even know how to translate that into an application.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>I also talked to a professor whose expertise is in navigation and building managers working in vision rehabilitation center, and made a prototype based on the opinions. Current prototype provides simple virtual navigation experience through sound; the direction is given and as the user navigates by using a keyboard, it gets updated. Along with the direction, environmental cues are provided sometimes as a descriptive text other times as a sound clip mimicking the environment.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>One of the insights from the interview was that psychological help is in need as much as the practical one; interviewees said the foremost obstacle of the navigation is the "fear" of being out navigating. Before educating the blind population the navigation strategy, educating the exploration spirit was prerequisite. Also, the concept of internal cues--understanding the distance and orientation based on one's own movements so that the visually impaired people do not have to rely on temporary/transient cue-- was also interesting. Combining those two, I suggested making an educational navigation game for the blind population for a future development. For example, the quest of the game can be mastering a certain route (being able to memorize the necessary steps to take in the right order.) A smart phone and its accelerometer can provide an adequate feedback while the student is playing the game and memorizing the route so that they can practice navigating around indoor, virtually, in the format of playing a game.&nbsp;</span></p>
