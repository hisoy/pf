        <span>The goal of this DARPA(Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) funded project was to develop an interactive game-based technologies. The main user was pre-k to grade three students and the target skills were STEM that include socio-emotional learning and creative ability.</span><br /><br /><span>I was in the SEL (Social and Emotional Learning) team and my role was to apply data mining technology to natural language, gestural, and other acoustic data recorded while children play the game and develop a series of evaluation for children's social and emotional engagement. I reviewed related literature as well as existing assessments, coded children's collaboration behavior and designed a computer based assessment through multiple iterations of design and prototyping.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>I learned how the various professors and departments collaborate in a university setting. It was a great chance to see how a big project is organized : how to make a specialized group, how to facilitate communication among different groups, how to make a step-by-step progress and how to sync various groups. It was also fun to think socio-emotional aspects of human in the perspectives of an assessment maker. It is obviously true that the concept of socio-emotional skill is complex and somewhat vague that certain compromise had be made to find a sweet spot that is not considered as a generalization of behavior pattern while keep maintaining the reliability.</span><br /><br /><span>- Publication</span><br /><span>Vincent Aleven, Steven Dow, Michael Christel, Scott Stevens, Carolyn Ros&eacute;, Kenneth Koedinger, Brad Myers, Julia Brynn Flynn, Zane Hintzman, Erik Harpstead, Soyeon Hwang &ldquo; Supporting Social - Emotional Development in Collaborative Inquiry Games for K - 3 Science Learning &rdquo; , Proceedings of the Games+Learning+Society Conference 9.0 &ndash; GLS 9.0, Madison, WI, June 12 - 14, 2013.</span></p>
