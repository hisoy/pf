          <span>Going to a college that has strong engineering programs, I was always surrounded by lots of tech-savvy classmates, Yet, from the very first moment that we started talking to farmers for our capstone project, it was obvious that technology is simply a pain in the butt to some people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>For our graduation project, we got to work with Platypus, a spin-off company from a robotics institute in CMU that is developing this robot. Unlike the traditional water monitoring system, this Platypus robot can provide a real time monitoring data in an affordable price. It creates detailed spatiotemporal maps of water quality parameters such as specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen, temperature and pH. The company was trying to figure out a way to visualize the data that the robot collects and it was our job to be the design consultant and come up with an interface.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The field research of farm seemed like a good place to start the project. We drove for like an hour to visit Bear Lakes, and looked around neighboring farms with the kind help of a farmer, Mr.Blake. Mr.Blake said he himself was very interested in water quality of this lake as it is his family's property. He was concerned about recent shell developments and the potential impact of freaking on the water quality. However, he said, not many farmers spend time and efforts in the quality of water as long as it does not damage their crops.</span></p>
<p><span><span>I led the user research and competitive research. We started from visiting farmer's market and talked to farmers, rauchers, timberer and florist. Later, we also talked to a professor and students as Pltaypus robot got attention from some educators. During first couple interviews, I was overwhelmed by how different the potential users can be. Not just the technical familiarity but also their interests in water data varied drastically and it appeared that one insight earned from one interview become very irrelevant in another interview.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Instead of following the traditional approach of generating person based on the commonalities of the interviews, we came up with a solution of grouping the interviewees based on two major axis, and creating persona for each category. This categorization helped us a lot in understanding the holistic spectrum of user population and also envisioning user interaction.</span></p>
<p><span><span>After collecting all the insights, we decided designing interaction. We summarized the current flow and delivery of the water quality data and needs identified from different groups of farmers. Then based on the diverse features collected from competitors, we matched the feature that we need. Two key focus was first, to make a simple and efficient data visualization of the comprehensive water quality data and second, to design an intuitive navigation flow that non tech savvy user can easily recognize. The first low-fi paper prototype came out, and we had a first round of user test.&nbsp;</span><br /><span>The most significant issue during the user test was, Frank group, farmer who is not fluent with technology and has no background of water quality wanted to get as minimal information as possible. We included another features such as 'traffic light' symbol that simply visualizes the condition for each parameter.</span></span></p>
<p><span>The final minimized the usage of color in data visualization. Simply red, yellow and green show the overall status of the lake in a concordant manner. Question mark is included in the items so that if user is not familiar with the parameter or the term, user can get a quick information about it. we also invented a new feature based on the user interview, which is sharing the report in a simple easy-click manner. When something happens in the lake, a quick cooperation between the relevant authority &amp; environmentalist is in great need and by this report system, every farmer can alert one another and solve the potential catastrophe.&nbsp;</span></p>
