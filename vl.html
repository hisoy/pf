          <p>I found a job posting online. A hostel in&nbsp;Rio de Janiero&nbsp;was looking for helpers. I was taking a gap year, teaching children in Madrid at that moment. Europe was charming, however, South America was my dream destination and the famous carnival season of Brazil was coming. I sent an email. I bought the ticket. There was no time to hesitate.&nbsp;<br /><br />When I arrived in the airport of Rio de Janeiro, I saw a man dressed in a pink tutu. It did not take much time to figure out that I got into a different planet. Endless and mindless blocos(street parades) during carnival made the conviction stronger. When the carnival was over and people slowly started working, I joined the painting work. Yet, painting under the Brazilian summer sun was pretty exhausting.<br /><br />One evening, I got a chance to talk to the owner, Paul. He was busy managing a hostel, raising a kid, and making his own music. As the Worldcup and Olympic is coming, he was even busier renovating the hostel and taking care of various helpers who have flied into hostel from all over the world.&nbsp;Are you interested in re-designing your website?&nbsp;I asked him. I checked that the original website was old. He said he was thinking about that although he hadn't had the time. I took the initiative and showed him a pitch of a design the next morning. He liked the design and convinced that I am capable of building a website; yet, it seemed like he had another design that he wanted. He told me, go talk to Rosie, another helper who was in charge of rennovating the hostel.</p>
<p>Chilling inside the terrace with an iced water, ocasionally surfing websites of other hostels, I thought about why Paul only 'liked' my design pitch instead of totally buying it. The design that I suggested was quite fresh. Big background image and large texts reflected new web design trend and the image I used emphasized the view from the terrace as well. I wanted to ask him more questions, but before that, I talked to Rosie. Rosie was in charge of planning the entire renovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The website design followed the main color and keywords. Retro image is conveyed through the&nbsp;typeface&nbsp;and&nbsp;old-styled title header. The image of nature is delivered by the&nbsp;comb layout&nbsp;and a picture of a leaf next to the comb.To enhance the&nbsp;traveler&nbsp;image, an old map of South America is used as a background, which also strengthens the vintage look. Overall interaction and the design of sub page resembles that of a&nbsp;simple storybook. Each sub-page has images on the left side and the narration on the right side. Visitor can follow the linear flow of the story by using arrow buttons, while it is always possible to go to the main page that has an access to every story. Booking page is also accessible in every sub-page.&nbsp;<br /><br />It took about a month, taking pictures for the website, designing the website, and helping painting from time to time. By the time this website making was done, Paul asked if I could design T shirts that all staff can wear and I gladly took the suggestion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>South American map and the plant image from the website is carried onto the t-shirt design . The name of Villa Leonor and the plant is placed on the Rio de Janeiro's location on the map and two circles which remind of ship's wheel is surrounding Villa Leonor. It emphasizes the letter while delivering the adventure spirit. Next time I visit Rio, I will be able to try these shirts on! :-)</p>
