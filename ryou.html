                Course work : Designing a tangible game interface (a week, Fall 2014)<br>in collaboration with Francesca Maina<br>Arduino, Rhino 3D

          <span>After a week period of getting familiar with arduino, we got a brief to make an interactive game for two players. As soon as I heard the word 'two player game', one thing came into my mind, a game that lets you say everything to the other person. Original idea was like this.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Basically it is a new type of mind game that gets its motif from a Turing test.&nbsp;</span><br /><span>The player becomes either quizzer or guesser; the quizzer say a statement starting with 'I think you are', such as 'I think you are secretly into me.' The other person has to make a judgement if that statement was from the robot, or from the player. During this entire guessing processer, two players will see and examine each other&rsquo;s eyes through eye holes in the robot. Francesca liked my idea. We became a team and develop this idea further. She specified the shape of the game and laser printed all the parts by using a Rhino model. I focused on programming arduino and building a circuit.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Original idea used a LCD to print out the statment, however, at the last minute, our LCD stopped working. It was replaced by old fashioned mail box with rolled messages in it. Other things were implemented as we visualized at first. The score of each player is recorded by LED strip inside the mouse of the R-you robot and the little LED light on top o the mail box delivers the guesser's answer to the quizzer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>People Loved playing with R-you, and one student who came to the exhibition called this R-you as 'Red face making robot.' He got lots of statements such as&nbsp;</span><br /><em>'I think you are hot.'<br />'I think you are into my voice.'<br />'I think you are hard to forget.'<br />'I think you are thinking this is the best game in the world.'</em></span></p>
