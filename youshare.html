          <span>When Frog design gave a brief about designing a social mobile application, the very first idea was to make an app related to finding flats. Two of my classmates, Hanna and Carola, were also into this idea. We were all expats in the town. Hanna, a graphic designer from Norway, found a room relatively easily but she barely had any interaction with her housemates. Carola, an industrial designer from Germany, had a daughter who was about to go to college in a new city apart from home. And there was me, living in a temporary housing, still looking for a place to call home.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>After setting up the general direction of the app, we started user research and competitor analysis. Since I had experiences in user research, I led this phase of the design process. We got in touch with 7 students who have experiences of house searching in Ticino and conducted contextual interviews.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>We asked interviewees various questions about their experiences in finding housing and settling down in a new city, about their overall search plans, medium they used, search criteria, experiences related to flatmates and etc. We also studied our competitors, offline real-estate agencies, websites and mobile application. Although there were handful of websites and application specialized in housing serach, it was easy to find opportunities and needs for different application. To summarize,</span><br /><br /><span>Opportunities&nbsp;</span><br /><span>: Going through a regular real-estate agency is a hassle for a foreign student.&nbsp;</span><br /><span>: Quick response to a new property is important. Mobile app's real-time notification can be useful.</span><br />: Every interviewee gave 8 or higher (1-10 scale) for the importance of having a nice flatmate. However, it is&nbsp;not easy to get to know the flatmate with a simple description&nbsp;and some questions are hard to ask such as sexual orientation.<br /><br />Needs<br />: Students wanted reliable online services without scam property.<br />: A single line of address is not enough for newcomers to figure out what is going on in that location. : Students had a strong need to share houses with others.&nbsp;Living with others is not boring and more fun. It also gives practical and financial benefits&nbsp;in their first step of living without parents.<br />: Some students expect flatmates to be&nbsp;more than just acquaintances&nbsp;They want to watch movies, take a walk, and share music together and they are willing to spend time and effort to get to know the prospective flatmates.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>After the 3 days of user research and feature analysis, we got a concrete design idea for our app, Youshare. We envisioned a mobile application that takes a whole different approach on house sesarch. YouShare changes the paradigm of current house search&nbsp;from property&shy;-person match to inhabitants match. youShare matches and connects future housemates based on their needs and preferences. Housemates who are searching for a newcomer and the newcomer will be connected, and&nbsp;naturally property information will be delivered in a personal and reliable manner.</p>
<p><span>Now, we had to figure out how to design the mobile application so that it can maximizes the advantage of real-time information delivery. First of all, our main user was college students or young professionals. We decided to rely on the established design language for the users are comfortable with those. The common behavior pattern found in the user resesarch was, people usually start house searching (i.e, going through postings on the website) more than three months in advance but they do not get serious about it (making phone calls) until the moving date comes close. Therefore, the key feature of an app is an automated search (based upon the profile) and real-time notification.</span></p>
<p><span><span>We follow the flow of the dating apps; user will first make a profile verified by an email address or phone number, and answer various questions that are closely related to life as a housemate. This profile making process becomes a preliminary verification system. Then the user will see the result of matches. This match result can be filtered, for example, one can see the housemate who already has secured a place. We went through couple rounds of wireframing with an advice session from Frog design to come up with.</span><br /><br /><span>That was not the end. Last but not least, we tested our app Youshare with three users and presented the insights and future direction in the final presentation. </span></span><span>Frog design appreciated thorough user research and feedback analysis of the user testing. Students also were excited to see a change of perspective -- tedious house searching process turned into an opportunity to meet and connect with people. Overall, I was glad to have&nbsp;</span>an app that challenges the image of digital technology isolating people but instead questions&nbsp;'Wouldn't it be better to live with a person who welcomes you at home and with whom you can grab a beer together?'&nbsp;</p></div>
