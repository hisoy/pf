          <span>When Frog design gave a brief about designing a social mobile application, the very first idea was to make an app related to finding flats. Two of my classmates, Hanna and Carola, were also into this idea. We were all expats in the town. Hanna, a graphic designer from Norway, found a room relatively easily but she barely had any interaction with her housemates. Carola, an industrial designer from Germany, had a daughter who was about to go to college in a new city apart from home. And there was me, living in a temporary housing, still looking for a place to call home.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>After setting up the general direction of the app, we started user research and competitor analysis. Since I had experiences in user research, I led this phase of the design process. We got in touch with 7 students who have experiences of house searching in Ticino and conducted contextual interviews.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>We asked interviewees various questions about their experiences in finding housing and settling down in a new city, about their overall search plans, medium they used, search criteria, experiences related to flatmates and etc. We also studied our competitors, offline real-estate agencies, websites and mobile application. Although there were handful of websites and application specialized in housing serach, it was easy to find opportunities and needs for different application. To summarize,</span><br /><br /><span>Opportunities&nbsp;</span><br /><span>: Going through a regular real-estate agency is a hassle for a foreign student.&nbsp;</span><br /><span>: Quick response to a new property is important. Mobile app's real-time notification can be useful.</span><br />: Every interviewee gave 8 or higher (1-10 scale) for the importance of having a nice flatmate. However, it is&nbsp;not easy to get to know the flatmate with a simple description&nbsp;and some questions are hard to ask such as sexual orientation.<br /><br />Needs<br />: Students wanted reliable online services without scam property.<br />: A single line of address is not enough for newcomers to figure out what is going on in that location. : Students had a strong need to share houses with others.&nbsp;Living with others is not boring and more fun. It also gives practical and financial benefits&nbsp;in their first step of living without parents.<br />: Some students expect flatmates to be&nbsp;more than just acquaintances&nbsp;They want to watch movies, take a walk, and share music together and they are willing to spend time and effort to get to know the prospective flatmates.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>After the 3 days of user research and feature analysis, we got a concrete design idea for our app, Youshare. We envisioned a mobile application that takes a whole different approach on house sesarch. YouShare changes the paradigm of current house search&nbsp;from property&shy;-person match to inhabitants match. youShare matches and connects future housemates based on their needs and preferences. Housemates who are searching for a newcomer and the newcomer will be connected, and&nbsp;naturally property information will be delivered in a personal and reliable manner.</p>
<p><span>Now, we had to figure out how to design the mobile application so that it can maximizes the advantage of real-time information delivery. First of all, our main user was college students or young professionals. We decided to rely on the established design language for the users are comfortable with those. The common behavior pattern found in the user resesarch was, people usually start house searching (i.e, going through postings on the website) more than three months in advance but they do not get serious about it (making phone calls) until the moving date comes close. Therefore, the key feature of an app is an automated search (based upon the profile) and real-time notification.</span></p>
<p><span><span>We follow the flow of the dating apps; user will first make a profile verified by an email address or phone number, and answer various questions that are closely related to life as a housemate. This profile making process becomes a preliminary verification system. Then the user will see the result of matches. This match result can be filtered, for example, one can see the housemate who already has secured a place. We went through couple rounds of wireframing with an advice session from Frog design to come up with.</span><br /><br /><span>That was not the end. Last but not least, we tested our app Youshare with three users and presented the insights and future direction in the final presentation. </span></span><span>Frog design appreciated thorough user research and feedback analysis of the user testing. Students also were excited to see a change of perspective -- tedious house searching process turned into an opportunity to meet and connect with people. Overall, I was glad to have&nbsp;</span>an app that challenges the image of digital technology isolating people but instead questions&nbsp;'Wouldn't it be better to live with a person who welcomes you at home and with whom you can grab a beer together?'&nbsp;</p></div>

        This project started with discussion of IoT(Internet of Things) and a lecture of Bruce Sterling, the Scifi writer. He and professor Massimo Banzi were doing a project together, Casa Jasmina. This house is in Turin and it will be the demo-house of IoT where anyone can visit and experience one future of digital technology. When I got this brief, I was so excited. I love home, I love making new things, I always thought that I could spend my life to make things for home. My friends and I always talked about some possible inventions related to house, now I just have to choose one and build it!</p>
<p>In the first phase of ideation, there were Many ideas. A magnetic blanket, community garden made of lights, talking mirror and etc. Yet, the more I thought about each idea and talk about those with friends and classmates, the more I got confused. Why do we need More things? Is it necessary to waste all the resources, the labor force of factory workers and so on just to make more toys?</p>
<p>After iterations, Riccardo and I decided to focus on Lpify, a hybrid music player. Whenever I watch movies, I always was intrigued by mix-tape, collection of vinyls and cassettes. Having a hardcopy of a music felt really neat and personal. From there the idea of a music player run by vinyl with handwriting came out.</p>
<p>Initially, we maintained a box-shaped LP player. Yet, while talking about how to handle the que of vinyl records, we decided to use a slope. Slope became a track, and the track soon got attached to the wall.</p>
<p>I did the software part, recognizing the handwriting and connecting it to music streaming service with the help of python. Riccardo worked on arduino and actualizing the choreography. Installing layers of libraries (image processiong, OCR, music streaming API) was pretty fun. On the other hand, Ricarrdo suffered a lot due to unreliable plywoods, a subtle warping of the wood made LP record get stuck all the time and yeah, it was not easy.<br /> <br />This is the final prototype of Lpify. We minimized the appearance and unlike the first prototype, the choreography of moving one vinyl to the other is all covered and only can be assumed. (from the different height of vinyls, and the sound.) By simplifying the external design feature and using the same color vinyl, we wanted to draw attention to the core concept of Lpify. Music is more than an entertainment that floats around and fills the space. It is something that peoplechoose for themselves, something that people share and get bonded, and something that lasts.</p></div>

       After a week period of getting familiar with arduino, we got a brief to make an interactive game for two players. As soon as I heard the word 'two player game', one thing came into my mind, a game that lets you say everything to the other person. Original idea was like this.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Basically it is a new type of mind game that gets its motif from a Turing test.&nbsp;</span><br /><span>The player becomes either quizzer or guesser; the quizzer say a statement starting with 'I think you are', such as 'I think you are secretly into me.' The other person has to make a judgement if that statement was from the robot, or from the player. During this entire guessing processer, two players will see and examine each other&rsquo;s eyes through eye holes in the robot. Francesca liked my idea. We became a team and develop this idea further. She specified the shape of the game and laser printed all the parts by using a Rhino model. I focused on programming arduino and building a circuit.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Original idea used a LCD to print out the statment, however, at the last minute, our LCD stopped working. It was replaced by old fashioned mail box with rolled messages in it. Other things were implemented as we visualized at first. The score of each player is recorded by LED strip inside the mouse of the R-you robot and the little LED light on top o the mail box delivers the guesser's answer to the quizzer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>People Loved playing with R-you, and one student who came to the exhibition called this R-you as 'Red face making robot.' He got lots of statements such as&nbsp;</span><br /><em>'I think you are hot.'<br />'I think you are into my voice.'<br />'I think you are hard to forget.'<br />'I think you are thinking this is the best game in the world.'</em></span></p></div>

       I found a job posting online. A hostel in&nbsp;Rio de Janiero&nbsp;was looking for helpers. I was taking a gap year, teaching children in Madrid at that moment. Europe was charming, however, South America was my dream destination and the famous carnival season of Brazil was coming. I sent an email. I bought the ticket. There was no time to hesitate.&nbsp;<br /><br />When I arrived in the airport of Rio de Janeiro, I saw a man dressed in a pink tutu. It did not take much time to figure out that I got into a different planet. Endless and mindless blocos(street parades) during carnival made the conviction stronger. When the carnival was over and people slowly started working, I joined the painting work. Yet, painting under the Brazilian summer sun was pretty exhausting.<br /><br />One evening, I got a chance to talk to the owner, Paul. He was busy managing a hostel, raising a kid, and making his own music. As the Worldcup and Olympic is coming, he was even busier renovating the hostel and taking care of various helpers who have flied into hostel from all over the world.&nbsp;Are you interested in re-designing your website?&nbsp;I asked him. I checked that the original website was old. He said he was thinking about that although he hadn't had the time. I took the initiative and showed him a pitch of a design the next morning. He liked the design and convinced that I am capable of building a website; yet, it seemed like he had another design that he wanted. He told me, go talk to Rosie, another helper who was in charge of rennovating the hostel.</p>
<p>Chilling inside the terrace with an iced water, ocasionally surfing websites of other hostels, I thought about why Paul only 'liked' my design pitch instead of totally buying it. The design that I suggested was quite fresh. Big background image and large texts reflected new web design trend and the image I used emphasized the view from the terrace as well. I wanted to ask him more questions, but before that, I talked to Rosie. Rosie was in charge of planning the entire renovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The website design followed the main color and keywords. Retro image is conveyed through the&nbsp;typeface&nbsp;and&nbsp;old-styled title header. The image of nature is delivered by the&nbsp;comb layout&nbsp;and a picture of a leaf next to the comb.To enhance the&nbsp;traveler&nbsp;image, an old map of South America is used as a background, which also strengthens the vintage look. Overall interaction and the design of sub page resembles that of a&nbsp;simple storybook. Each sub-page has images on the left side and the narration on the right side. Visitor can follow the linear flow of the story by using arrow buttons, while it is always possible to go to the main page that has an access to every story. Booking page is also accessible in every sub-page.&nbsp;<br /><br />It took about a month, taking pictures for the website, designing the website, and helping painting from time to time. By the time this website making was done, Paul asked if I could design T shirts that all staff can wear and I gladly took the suggestion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>South American map and the plant image from the website is carried onto the t-shirt design . The name of Villa Leonor and the plant is placed on the Rio de Janeiro's location on the map and two circles which remind of ship's wheel is surrounding Villa Leonor. It emphasizes the letter while delivering the adventure spirit. Next time I visit Rio, I will be able to try these shirts on! :-)</p></div>

       <span>Going to a college that has strong engineering programs, I was always surrounded by lots of tech-savvy classmates, Yet, from the very first moment that we started talking to farmers for our capstone project, it was obvious that technology is simply a pain in the butt to some people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>For our graduation project, we got to work with Platypus, a spin-off company from a robotics institute in CMU that is developing this robot. Unlike the traditional water monitoring system, this Platypus robot can provide a real time monitoring data in an affordable price. It creates detailed spatiotemporal maps of water quality parameters such as specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen, temperature and pH. The company was trying to figure out a way to visualize the data that the robot collects and it was our job to be the design consultant and come up with an interface.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The field research of farm seemed like a good place to start the project. We drove for like an hour to visit Bear Lakes, and looked around neighboring farms with the kind help of a farmer, Mr.Blake. Mr.Blake said he himself was very interested in water quality of this lake as it is his family's property. He was concerned about recent shell developments and the potential impact of freaking on the water quality. However, he said, not many farmers spend time and efforts in the quality of water as long as it does not damage their crops.</span></p>
<p><span><span>I led the user research and competitive research. We started from visiting farmer's market and talked to farmers, rauchers, timberer and florist. Later, we also talked to a professor and students as Pltaypus robot got attention from some educators. During first couple interviews, I was overwhelmed by how different the potential users can be. Not just the technical familiarity but also their interests in water data varied drastically and it appeared that one insight earned from one interview become very irrelevant in another interview.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Instead of following the traditional approach of generating person based on the commonalities of the interviews, we came up with a solution of grouping the interviewees based on two major axis, and creating persona for each category. This categorization helped us a lot in understanding the holistic spectrum of user population and also envisioning user interaction.</span></p>
<p><span><span>After collecting all the insights, we decided designing interaction. We summarized the current flow and delivery of the water quality data and needs identified from different groups of farmers. Then based on the diverse features collected from competitors, we matched the feature that we need. Two key focus was first, to make a simple and efficient data visualization of the comprehensive water quality data and second, to design an intuitive navigation flow that non tech savvy user can easily recognize. The first low-fi paper prototype came out, and we had a first round of user test.&nbsp;</span><br /><span>The most significant issue during the user test was, Frank group, farmer who is not fluent with technology and has no background of water quality wanted to get as minimal information as possible. We included another features such as 'traffic light' symbol that simply visualizes the condition for each parameter.</span></span></p>
<p><span>The final minimized the usage of color in data visualization. Simply red, yellow and green show the overall status of the lake in a concordant manner. Question mark is included in the items so that if user is not familiar with the parameter or the term, user can get a quick information about it. we also invented a new feature based on the user interview, which is sharing the report in a simple easy-click manner. When something happens in the lake, a quick cooperation between the relevant authority &amp; environmentalist is in great need and by this report system, every farmer can alert one another and solve the potential catastrophe.&nbsp;</span></p></div>

      <span>About the time of graduation, I read an interesting article about ICTD, Information and Communication Technology for Development. As I have been harboring doubt about the "cool" digital technology (i.e, where is the "meaning" in digital technology?") ICTD seemed really attractive and I wanted to be a part of the relevant project. I contacted Dr. Bernardine who was working on the field and got a chance to join her project, Navpal. The goal of the project was to provide safe and independent navigation of urban environments for the blind population. My role was to understand the navigation of visually impaired population and design an virtual indoor navigation system. The very idea of developing an application for disabled people was new and exciting.</span><br /><br /><span>A highlight of the project was user research: meeting visually impaired people. One interviewee talked about how he enjoys exploring surrounding environments by using canes, which made me stunned. Would I ever be able to enjoy the surrounding, when I can't see anything, when I have to pay close attention to slight inclination of the roads, when there is a high probability that I can get hit by a car, when my outside surrounding has been the source of pain, accidents, troubles from the beginning of my life? I'll rather stay inside my crib, listening to music, occasionally cursing my life. The positive and proactive attitude of interviewees was very provocative; I didn't even know how to translate that into an application.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>I also talked to a professor whose expertise is in navigation and building managers working in vision rehabilitation center, and made a prototype based on the opinions. Current prototype provides simple virtual navigation experience through sound; the direction is given and as the user navigates by using a keyboard, it gets updated. Along with the direction, environmental cues are provided sometimes as a descriptive text other times as a sound clip mimicking the environment.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>One of the insights from the interview was that psychological help is in need as much as the practical one; interviewees said the foremost obstacle of the navigation is the "fear" of being out navigating. Before educating the blind population the navigation strategy, educating the exploration spirit was prerequisite. Also, the concept of internal cues--understanding the distance and orientation based on one's own movements so that the visually impaired people do not have to rely on temporary/transient cue-- was also interesting. Combining those two, I suggested making an educational navigation game for the blind population for a future development. For example, the quest of the game can be mastering a certain route (being able to memorize the necessary steps to take in the right order.) A smart phone and its accelerometer can provide an adequate feedback while the student is playing the game and memorizing the route so that they can practice navigating around indoor, virtually, in the format of playing a game.&nbsp;</span></p></div>

     <span>The goal of this DARPA(Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) funded project was to develop an interactive game-based technologies. The main user was pre-k to grade three students and the target skills were STEM that include socio-emotional learning and creative ability.</span><br /><br /><span>I was in the SEL (Social and Emotional Learning) team and my role was to apply data mining technology to natural language, gestural, and other acoustic data recorded while children play the game and develop a series of evaluation for children's social and emotional engagement. I reviewed related literature as well as existing assessments, coded children's collaboration behavior and designed a computer based assessment through multiple iterations of design and prototyping.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>I learned how the various professors and departments collaborate in a university setting. It was a great chance to see how a big project is organized : how to make a specialized group, how to facilitate communication among different groups, how to make a step-by-step progress and how to sync various groups. It was also fun to think socio-emotional aspects of human in the perspectives of an assessment maker. It is obviously true that the concept of socio-emotional skill is complex and somewhat vague that certain compromise had be made to find a sweet spot that is not considered as a generalization of behavior pattern while keep maintaining the reliability.</span><br /><br /><span>- Publication</span><br /><span>Vincent Aleven, Steven Dow, Michael Christel, Scott Stevens, Carolyn Ros&eacute;, Kenneth Koedinger, Brad Myers, Julia Brynn Flynn, Zane Hintzman, Erik Harpstead, Soyeon Hwang &ldquo; Supporting Social - Emotional Development in Collaborative Inquiry Games for K - 3 Science Learning &rdquo; , Proceedings of the Games+Learning+Society Conference 9.0 &ndash; GLS 9.0, Madison, WI, June 12 - 14, 2013.</span></p></div>
